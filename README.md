# Saracasm Detection
This project aimed to use Machine Learning to detect sarcasm in a custom made "News" Headline inputed by the user. 
Additionally the user is able to decide which of these four Classifiers they want to use to evaluate their custom headline: "Naive Bayes, k-nearest Neighbor, Random Forrest and Support Vector Machines. 
If you chose more than one the output of the better model will be taken.

## Libraries/Modules used

- sklearn
- sklearnex (https://intel.github.io/scikit-learn-intelex/installation.html)
- numpy
- matplotlib
- pandas
- easygui (https://pypi.org/project/easygui/)
- json
- re
- nltk

## Data Preprocessing 
Luisa

## Classifiers + Evaluation

- Naive Bayes: Luisa
- KNN: Vanessa
- Random Forrest: Shabnam
- SVM: Isa

## userInput.py
The file has two functions: user_Input() and headline_Input()
With easygui the headline input and which classifier the user wants is saved.
